Intro:
This project is a proof of concept.
Refrigerator Raider will provide customers with a helpful tool for managing their home or work refrigerators with helpful reminders for when items run low. It will be a web-based application so that users can access the application on almost any device and on-the-go.

Please see the PDF for a holistic explanation of the project. 
If you wish to run or access the application feel free to download the application.zip 
and load it into Eclipse or your preferred IDE
