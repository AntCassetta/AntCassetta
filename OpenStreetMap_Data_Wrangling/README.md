Intent:
The intention of this project is to illustrate the programmatic data wrangling process, in Python, from raw user generated xml data into a tidy data set housed within a SQLite schema.
Please note this is an example and thus does not exhaustively walkthrough cleaning the entire dataset as one would before formal investigation.

For a brief summary of the process and results see wrangling_data_analysis.pdf

For the Python code see either the HTML or Jupyter note book file titled ant_cassetta_wrangle_project
